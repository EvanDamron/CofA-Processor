# This is just a thought about using a controller system that interfaces the separate modules.
# The goal would be for this controller to use the modules, passing around the text file and
# using the information gathered from the modules to pull the actual data and insert it into the 
# database. It could also serve as the way the GUI extracts data. Really it would be the link
# between the frontend and backend.
